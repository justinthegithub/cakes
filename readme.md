## Hello, recursers!

###I thought this might be a good alternative to tic-tac-toe. There are rule changes and analyses that I already have in mind.  

###I took some of these ideas away from reading Conway's book.

1. The game can be played in multiple dimensions. A third dimension would have cuts made by either player. Still deterministic.

2. Each piece cut could have a random value either known or unknown in order to have a different final winner.
