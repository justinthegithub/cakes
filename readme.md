## Hello, recursers!

I thought this might be a good alternative to tic-tac-toe. As is, it is even simpler but there are some ways it could be developed. 

A sheet cake is being cut up according to specific scored lines.  Players select one direction to cut and do not want to be the person who has no option to make a further cut. 


I'd like to add to it and may do so before the code is looked at. A couple of variations come to mind. I took some of these ideas away from reading "Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays"

1. The game can be played in multiple dimensions. A third dimension would have cuts made by either player.

2. Each piece cut could have a random value either known or unknown in the calculation of a winner.

3. Values for each move could be tracked according to one of the systems Conway provides.
